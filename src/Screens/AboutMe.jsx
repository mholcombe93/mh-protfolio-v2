        <p className=" Bio">
          I am a software engineer who enjoys bridging the gaps between usability, functionality, and creativity. Drawing from my ten years experience of working in the entertainment industry as a lighting designer, light programmer, and technical supervisor I have honed my abilities to analyze and prioritize the problems at hand, aiming to find multiple answers, and work with a team to implement the most optimal solution.
          I thrive in teams with a core in communication and collaboration, and contribute a unique eye and thought process derived from a fast paced, and sometimes hectic, environment where keeping calm and solving problems leads to a successful piece of art.My work illuminates my passions as a builder, contributor, and strategist, with a complementary eye of aesthetics, all coalescing into an ambitious  software engineer ready to take on complex assignments and grow into a key asset of any team.

          Before beginning my career as a software developer. I worked ten years professionally in the theatre industry as a lighting designer, lighting programer, and master electrician. Along the way i mastered the art of team collaboration and building something from nothing but ideas.

          When not immersed in the world of the web design and project management, I am an avid World of Warcraft raider with two realm-first titles and a guild officer position to a group of 400+ active players acting as community leader and often managing disputes between guild members.
          I love to spend time in the gym working of my strength and hypertrophy training, and hope to compete in my first competition in a year for a 460lbs deadlift.  
          I am a member and activist in the LGBT community having spoken in front of large crowds and conferences discussing history of the community and where we can grow.
          Lastly I am obsessed with the color burgundy, and anything having to do with to red pandas.
