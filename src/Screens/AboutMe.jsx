        <p className=" Bio_Software">
        I am a software engineer who enjoys bridging the gaps between usability, functionality, and creativity. Drawing from my ten years experience of working in the entertainment industry as a lighting designer, light programmer, and technical supervisor I have honed my abilities to analyze and prioritize the problems at hand, aiming to find multiple answers, and work with a team to implement the most optimal solution. I thrive in teams with a core in communication and collaboration, and contribute a unique eye and thought process derived from a fast paced, and sometimes hectic, environment where keeping calm and solving problems leads to a successful piece of art. My work illuminates my passions as a builder, contributor, and strategist, with a complementary eye of aesthetics, all coalescing into an ambitious  software engineer ready to take on complex assignments and grow into a key asset of any team.
